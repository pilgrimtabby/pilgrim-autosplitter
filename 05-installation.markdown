# Installation

You can download the latest build and the source code [here](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/releases/).

{: .important }
The source code should work on Windows and MacOS, but the built app is currently only available on MacOS. See [this page](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more details.

For a step-by-step guide to installation on Windows and MacOS, including tips for installing and running Python, see [this page](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
