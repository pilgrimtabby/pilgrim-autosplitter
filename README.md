# Pilgrim Autosplitter

This project is still under construction. You may experiences crashes or other errors; feel free to submit an issue or open a pull request if you run into problems.

## Compatibility

### Pilgrim Autosplitter works on MacOS and Windows!

Pilgrim Autosplitter was designed for MacOS users to fill the gap left by other image-based autosplitters, which generally only support Windows.

This program has only been minimally tested on Windows, so there may be unknown issues. If you encounter any problems, submit an issue or open a pull request. 

I don't have plans to introduce Linux support, but if you're interested in adding such support, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Installation

For now, the only installation option is to download the source code and run src/pilgrim_autosplitter.py using Python 3.9 or higher:

`python3 src/pilgrim_autosplitter.py`

Detailed instructions and other installation methods coming soon!
