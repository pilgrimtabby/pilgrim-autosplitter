# Installation

You can download the latest build for your operating system [here](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/releases/latest).

If you'd like to run the source code directly (Python), here's a [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/issues) on Pilgrim Autosplitter's repository page or email me directly at pilgrimtabby@gmail.com.
