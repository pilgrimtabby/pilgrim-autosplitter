# Installation

You can download the latest build or the source code [here](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/releases/).

{: .important }
The source code works on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. However, the built app is currently not available for Intel-based Macs or AMD Linux builds. See [this page](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for more details.

Even if you can't use the built app, running the source code is straightforward following this [step-by-step guide](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/pilgrimtabby/pilgrim-autosplitter/issues) on Pilgrim Autosplitter's repository page or email me directly at pilgrimtabby@gmail.com.
